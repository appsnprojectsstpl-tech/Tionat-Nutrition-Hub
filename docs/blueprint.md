## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant orange (#FF7849) to evoke a sense of health, energy, and appetite appeal.
- Background color: Light peach (#FFF2EB), a gentle tint of the primary color, to create a warm, inviting backdrop without overpowering the content.
- Accent color: A warm red (#D14927) placed close to orange in the color wheel, used sparingly to highlight key actions and draw attention.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text. 'Poppins' provides a modern, geometric look for titles, while 'PT Sans' offers readability and a touch of warmth for longer content.
- Use minimalist line icons with rounded edges to maintain a friendly and approachable feel. Icons related to nutrition, health, and time-of-day meal categories (breakfast, lunch, etc.) should be emphasized.
- Employ a card-based layout similar to Zepto, prioritizing quick navigation and visual clarity. Categories and products should be easily scannable on both storefront and admin panels. 'New Arrival' and 'Coming Soon' badges need consistent placement on product cards.
- Use subtle animations for transitions and feedback, such as cart updates or point accumulation notifications. Animations should be smooth and fast to maintain a Zepto-like speed.
